This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
Glink="https://github.com/543-Van-Deliverables/Deliverable-2/raw/main/"
Flink="CountryRankingFinal.csv"
CRF=read.csv(paste0(Glink,Flink))
```
```{r}
names(CRF)
```


```{r}
summary(CRF$Fertility)
```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
base=ggplot(data=CRF, aes(x=Region, y=Fertility))
base+geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,size = 8,vjust = .5))
```
```{r}
tapply(CRF$Fertility,CRF$Region, summary)
```
```{r}
titleText="Fertility Rates of Women Around the World"

baseflip=base + geom_boxplot() + 
        labs(title = titleText)

baseflip  + coord_flip()
```


```{r}
baseHY=ggplot(data=CRF,aes(x=Fertility)) 
histHY=baseHY + geom_histogram(aes(fill=Region), color='black')
histHY + ggtitle("Fertility Rates of Women Around the World") + labs(x="Fertility (children born/woman)",y="Count")  
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
